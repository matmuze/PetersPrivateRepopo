\section{Use Cases}
%[we just learned about the pipeline - now we want to know how it can be actually used - surprise: we actually have a proof of concept implementation of it]
Real world illustrators now can use this pipeline of metamorphers to create continuous representations that depict a desired metamorphosis of a given source representation to an intended target representation by combining the metamorphers on each pipeline stage that create the intended relations between the source and the target representation. %that answer specific questions / relate two different representations to each other
To actually enable an illustrator to apply our method, we created a proof of concept implementation of our pipeline.
%[then we explain the usecase setting based on the data - give details on the data]
In order to apply our method to solve relevant problems, we approached an illustrator and, in collaboration, created three different use cases for a data set of HIV. 
This data set represents an HIV particle contained within blood serum \textbf{(see Figure XXX)}. The three questions that we helped to answer with our demonstration are: 1) what does the three dimensional structure of the virus and its inner compartments actually look like and how do they relate to each other hierarchically? 2) what types of molecules are contained in which compartment of virus, how do they look like, and in which approximate quantity are they present? 3) how large is the volume of each compartment and the molecules contained within in respect to each other?

%[first we motivate why illustrators would want to use the pipeline]



\subsection{Explosion of Molecular Structures}
	%[motivate it - what problem does it solve in presenting the data]
Since molecular structures of the HIV data are very densely packed, it is impossible to inspect the outer and inner structures of the virus at the same time. To answer our first question, we chose to reprsent the virus in an exploded view.

We can achieve this with our pipeline in the following way:
We want to show the

\subsection{Schematization of Molecular Structures}
	%[motivate it - what problem does it solve in presenting the data]
	The data consists of 42 types of molecules, that have a total of XXX number of instances, consisting of a total number of YYY atoms.
