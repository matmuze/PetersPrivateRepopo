\subsection{Metamorphers}
\textbf{ [just for reference]}
[describes PoC components that we implemented per pipeline stage]\newline
[should we describe beforehand what (which representations) we try to achieve with these implementations?]


\subsubsection{Partitioning}
		spatial subselection by clipping plane/object,
		
		splitting into types,
		
		splitting into type ranges
		
		cloning
		
		---not showcased but implemented:		
		*spatial splitting operations into equal parts (pie splitter),
	
\subsubsection{Annotations}
text labels,
icons (textures),
maybe: data representatives (for each type),
optional addon to each operator: connectors between annotation \& assigned subset

\subsubsection{Blending / Morphing}
		
		blur into collective shape,		
		morph,
		
		---not showcased but implemented:				
		blending to texture
		
		---other not implemented \& not used examples:
		unfolding
		
\subsubsection{Layouting}

bar,
line,
translate,
rotate,
scale,
schematization layout = combi of scale \& rotate but selection of elements where what op is applied is very specific

---not showcased but implemented:	
			slice,
			sphere,
			circle

\subsubsection{Camera / Guided Navi}
[whole-data-in-view-keeper] update the camera pos \& lookat to keep all molecules in the view frustum.

other examples:


\subsubsection{Trajectory}
	
		linear: from A straight to B,
		bundling/transit points
		
		---other not implemented \& not used examples:
		curved
		
\subsubsection{Timing}

offset function: delay timing by distance to plane
 \& staging by type ... anything else?
			
		---other not implemented \& not used examples:
	offset according to: inherent spatial parameters (position, distance to other entities, density)
			
\subsubsection{Sampling}

continuous sampling,

		---other not implemented \& not used examples:
sparse (comic strip / narrative sequence),

post-processing operators:
motion blur,
