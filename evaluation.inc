\section{Evaluation}

Our visualization techniques have the versatility to be useful for both, scientific exploration of large bio-molecular scene, and educational purposes.

Therefore, we evaluate the potential impact of our tool by collecting informal user feedback from different types of experts domain.

In both cases we did a remote walk-through introduction of our software, while collecting feedback. Additionally we also gave them an executable version all collected a short written description of their first impression.

We first sent an early version of our tool to a biomedical illustrator with a strong academic background in biochemistry and XX years of experience in the field.

Here is a quote from his written feedback:



One very useful feature of the software is the possibility to “cut” plane of interest of a particular space keeping the information of all “layers” creating a “gradient” of concentration of the ingredient of the recipe shown. A visualization that reminds an “exploded model” but for biological assembly and it can be achieved without selecting by hand every instance you would like to hide.

I had the chance to test the software and in my opinion it can be a very useful  toolkit  for an illustrator in the biomedical field. 
I was really impressed by the quality of the non photo realistic toon rendering that can be achieved .
It makes  the user able to create rendering of very complex scenes in few seconds that can be exported and tweaked for the final look in a composite software making the preproduction of high quality static rendering very fast
I’ve never seen so far software that was able to manage with such a huge number of molecules/atoms without crashing. It also seems very promising for interactive teaching and also for animation purpose.




Comments on cellVIEW clipping/cutting environment

This work provides a state-of-the-art and powerful interactive environment for visualizing and exploring  3D models of complex cellular environments with molecular detail.  Much of the problems in viewing and isolating various components of the model are assisted by the functions of this clipping environment.  Below are comments on some of the features and their utility

The ability to specify which components are clipped and which are not affected by any number of clipping objects is quite flexible and thus very useful in exploring various components of the model.  

Hierarchical clipping is readily set up enabling successive objects to be “stripped away”.
Multiple clipping objects also enables the construction of various volumes to be tailored for instructive illustrations.

The ability to clip with various polygonal and polyhedral surfaces is quite useful for focusing in on regions of the model volume.   It is especially useful for examining the local environment around a particular feature or molecule.

The aperture cutting feature is especially useful for exploring a feature or object in the context of a crowded molecular environment.  The ability to shade the model with the aperture cut hightens the impression that the object being viewed is embedded in the volume.  Without the shading the object in the aperture appears to be floating above the surrounding environment, when the model is interactively manipulated.

The ability to retain a subset of the clipped object (“fuzzy clipping”) is an interesting feature that could be very useful under certain circumstances.  If one wants to get an impression of reducing the concentration of some of the molecular ingredients, or of what a gradient of certain molecular ingredients would look like, this feature could be useful. Also, if the selection of the unclipped objects were based upon some molecular ingredient feature, such as the molecular weight, or the order in which the ingredient was placed in the cellPACK fill, this would generate useful information.  The approach would become even more useful if the selection of the unclipped objects could be based upon relationships between ingredients, such as retaining only selected molecules that are neighbors of one another.
