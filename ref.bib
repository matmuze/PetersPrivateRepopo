 abstract = {In this paper, we present design principles for cutaway visualizations
  that emphasize shape and depth communication of the focus
  features and their relation to the context. First, to eliminate
  cutaway-flatness we argue that the cutaway axis should have an angular
  offset from the view direction. Second, we recommend creating
  a box-shaped cutaway. Such a simple cutaway shape allows for
  easier context extrapolation in the cutaway volume. Third, to improve
  the relationship between the focus features and the context,
  we propose to selectively align the cutaway shape to familiar structures
  in the context. Fourth, we emphasize that the illumination
  model should effectively communicate the shape and spatial ordering
  inside the cutaway, through shadowing as well as contouring
  and other stylized shading models. Finally, we recommend relaxing
  the view-dependency constraint of the cutaway to improve the
  depth perception through the motion parallax. We have identified
  these design principles while developing interactive cutaway visualizations
  of 3D geological models, inspired by geological illustrations
  and discussions with the domain illustrators and experts.}

  abstract =   "In this article we introduce cellVIEW, a new system to
               interactively visualize large biomolecular datasets on the
               atomic level. Our tool is unique and has been specifically
               designed to match the ambitions of our domain experts to
               model and interactively visualize structures comprised of
               several billions atom. The cellVIEW system integrates
               acceleration techniques to allow for real-time graphics
               performance of 60 Hz display rate on datasets representing
               large viruses and bacterial organisms. Inspired by the work
               of scientific illustrators, we propose a level-of-detail
               scheme which purpose is two-fold: accelerating the rendering
               and reducing visual clutter. The main part of our datasets
               is made out of macromolecules, but it also comprises nucleic
               acids strands which are stored as sets of control points.
               For that specific case, we extend our rendering method to
               support the dynamic generation of DNA strands directly on
               the GPU. It is noteworthy that our tool has been directly
               implemented inside a game engine. We chose to rely on a
               third party engine to reduce software development work-load
               and to make bleeding-edge graphics techniques more
               accessible to the end-users. To our knowledge cellVIEW is
               the only suitable solution for interactive visualization of
               large bimolecular landscapes on the atomic level and is
               freely available to use and extend.",
