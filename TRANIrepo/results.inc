discuss transformation to histograms.

discuss schematization.

discuss comparison?	maybe as combination of transformation \& schematization

	\textbf{things that should be preserved:} depending on the usecase / representation - not all properties are essential for each representation form.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item instance level: position of instances
		\item type level: shape of types, relative size of types, color of types (?), number relation between types
		\item compartment level: shape/pos/size/color of compartments / structures
		\item global level: volumetric dimensions of the data
		\item todo: what else?
	\end{itemize}
