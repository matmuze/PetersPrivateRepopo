 abstract = {In this paper, we present design principles for cutaway visualizations
  that emphasize shape and depth communication of the focus
  features and their relation to the context. First, to eliminate
  cutaway-flatness we argue that the cutaway axis should have an angular
  offset from the view direction. Second, we recommend creating
  a box-shaped cutaway. Such a simple cutaway shape allows for
  easier context extrapolation in the cutaway volume. Third, to improve
  the relationship between the focus features and the context,
  we propose to selectively align the cutaway shape to familiar structures
  in the context. Fourth, we emphasize that the illumination
  model should effectively communicate the shape and spatial ordering
  inside the cutaway, through shadowing as well as contouring
  and other stylized shading models. Finally, we recommend relaxing
  the view-dependency constraint of the cutaway to improve the
  depth perception through the motion parallax. We have identified
  these design principles while developing interactive cutaway visualizations
  of 3D geological models, inspired by geological illustrations
  and discussions with the domain illustrators and experts.}
