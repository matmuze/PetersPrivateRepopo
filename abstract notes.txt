first message:context: cutaways = occlusion management technique in vis & illu

2nd: new method for authoring cutaway vis based on data (centric)
what separates us from other approaches?
multi instancing = data property
amount of instances = controlled to determine what is shown to the user
make sure that everything that should be shown is shown

Ã¼berleitung vis of visibility: histograms of visibility distribution.
what is cut away, what is visible, what is occluded

interaction with the vis:
like "sliders" in an equalizer
override natural setting that a clipping plane would provide

2stage process:
1) clipping plane
2) equalizer for tweaking

histograms:
1) not yet interactive: gives info about visibility
2) now we know about visibility: we change the histo to adapt how we want the visibility to be

mention evaluation / prototype testing with domain experts in scientific illustration
